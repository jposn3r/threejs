### Learning ThreeJS

Let's see what we can build in 3D with JavaScript

## Potential Phases

### Phase 1

Initial Load
- Loading animation while the models load to the scene and start animating
- Welcome scene/layout

### Phase 2

Interaction and movement
- Secondary scene/layout
- Smooth animation between the Welcome scene/layout and the secondary scene/layout
