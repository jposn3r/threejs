# Needs

1. Make multiple scenes and properly structure your code
Scene 1: Entrance to the digital world
Scene 2: Home area
Scene 3: Inventory
Scene 4: Another dimension

# Ideas

## 1. Slow mo button - 
turns all animations to 1/60th of time scale and maybe zooms in on master chief walking

## 2. Fubo cube additional metadata overlay
when you click on fubo cube it should give you an indicator like a glow or ring underneath to show it's being focused
also to do additional things like see website or see when the stock price

## 3. Joystick navigation

## 4. Arcade Cabinet 
Build a portal to games as an old school arcade cabinet
Build a cabinet that has all the old games loaded in aka linked to a website where they can play them on the screen
could get the joystick navigation as input

## 5. Interactivity with animation
